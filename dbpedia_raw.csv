Billirakis won the first tournament of the 2007 World Series of Poker winning the $5,000 World Championship Mixed Hold'em Limit/No-Limit event after beating Canadian poker player and former professional hockey player Greg Mueller heads-up. Billirakis won $536,287 and became the then youngest WSOP bracelet winner in history, having won the event only 11 days after his 21st birthday. The previous record holder was Jeff Madsen, who had set the record only the year before. Billirakis' record was broken on the 10 September 2007 when Annette Obrestad won the main event of the World Series of Poker Europe where the age limit was only 18 years. Prior to signing up for this mixed hold'em event, Billirakis had never played limit hold'em. His friends gave him a crash course in the days leading up to the event. On one key hand when they were heads up, Mueller had made top pair against Billirakis's trips. When Billirakis raised on the river, Mueller made a feint of putting chips into the pot to attempt to get a read on whether Billirakis wanted him to call. While not a formal breach of the rules, ESPN commentator Norman Chad opined that such plays \""ain't kosher\"" according to poker etiquette. Mueller was then short-stacked and called the big blind with 5♦ 4♦. Billirakis raised Mueller all-in with K♠ 2♦. The board came down J♦ Q♥ 2♠ 8♥ Q♠, giving Billirakis the winning hand with two pair queens and deuces. In November, Billirakis won the 2008 WSOP Circuit Event - Horseshoe Hammond, $5,150 Championship, earning $208,885. As of 2014, Billirakis's total live tournament winnings exceed $2,625,000.

The left-handed pitcher appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955–1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Benton, Mississippi, Waters attended the University of Southern Mississippi. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the Pirates, Waters had a 13-season (1949–58; 1960–62) pitching career in minor league baseball. He was first signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only six-for-one trade in Major League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. Waters appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. His first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4–0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and sat out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama–Florida League. In three seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41–13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681–664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62."
"Chen Changxing or Ch'en Chang-hsing (1771–1853) was a 14th generation descendant and 6th generation master of the Chen Family and was an influential martial artist and teacher of taijiquan (t'ai chi ch'uan). Chen Changxing is a slightly mysterious character and much controversy surrounds him. He is most known as the teacher of the great taijiquan master Yang Luchan, but there is much disagreement over which style of martial art Chen Changxing actually taught to the family outsider. Some schools of thought suggest that Chen Changxing was a maverick who practiced and taught a style of martial art that was not part of the Chen Family martial arts tradition, and that was passed to him either directly or indirectly from a taijiquan master known as Jiang Fa. Other schools of thought suggest that Chen Changxing re-worked two or more of the traditional Chen Family routines into his own style and then taught it to Yang Luchan and others. Both schools successfully explain why the taijiquan that Yang Luchan's descendants now practice is substantially different from the modern Chen routines, but neither theory can be completely substantiated and thus much controversy remains. Chen Changxing is said to have been of an irreverent character and was given the nickname \""Mr Ancestral Tablet\"" due to the directness of his posture. In the \""The Genealogy of the Chen Family\"" he is noted as a martial arts instructor, but the detail of the style he taught is not present."

"John Horgan (25 May 1950 - 10 June 2016) was an Irish hurler whose league and championship career with the Cork senior team spanned twelve years from 1969 to 1981. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game and as one of the most iconic Cork players of all time. Born near Barrack Street on the south side of Cork city, Horgan was introduced to hurling by his father, a county junior championship medal winner with Blackrock. He developed his skills at Sullivan's Quay CBS while simultaneously coming to prominence at underage levels with the Passage club, before transferring to Blackrock in 1968. Horgan went on to enjoy a hugely success career over the course of the next decade, becoming the only player to captain a team to three All-Ireland victories. He also won five Munster medals and five county senior championship medals. Horgan made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Cork minor panel. From three successive All-Ireland final appearances he won one All-Ireland medal in 1967.

Horgan made his senior debut for Cork in the Grounds Tournament in 1969, before later becoming a regular on the team during the 1969-70 league. Over the course of the next decade his blonde hair and his long, sweeping clearances from corner-back, made Horgan a cult hero in Cork.

She later admitted to having been doped. In 2005 she called for her last remaining record (German national record in the 400 m individual medley) to be struck from the record books, because it was achieved with the aid of steroids. Schneider came to prominence at the 1978 World Championships in Berlin, winning bronze in the 400 m individual medley behind arch-rival Tracy Caulkins of the United States with whom she shares the same birthday. Thereafter, she never lost to Caulkins again, repeatedly lowering Caulkins' world record in the event, three times in 1980 from 4:40.83 to 4:36.29 at the Moscow Olympics, which was boycotted by the United States.

However, her Olympic career was ended when the Soviet bloc, including East Germany, staged a retaliatory boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. Schneider attributed her success in swimming (prior to admissions of doping) with the quote For me swimming is the most beautiful of all sports. Although I have been training for very many years and have taken part in a great number of competitions, I always find something new in this sport. And this I'm sure is greatly to the credit of my coach, Eberhard Mothes, who takes my training sessions at the sport club in Karl-Marx-Stadt and never fails to come up with something interesting or challenging in the course of the work.

He would add his name, at some stage, to the roll of honour of almost every leading event in British professional golf, with the exception of the Open. Ward was born in Birmingham, England. Like many players his age, Ward's best years were denied to him by World War II, so it was fitting that he should win the very first professional event played after VE Day, the Daily Mail Victory Tournament at St Andrews. After his victory he returned late to his posting at an RAF base and as a punishment, was confined to barracks. Ward would win three events in 1948 (one of them in a tie), and gained more recognition for his 1949 season, his three wins that year including the rich Spalding and North British-Harrogate Tournaments and then the British Masters, also played that year at St Andrews. Further victories followed in 1950 (the Daily Mail Tournament at Walton Heath, which Ward won in a playoff against Bobby Locke and Australian Ossie Pickworth) and 1951 (the Dunlop Tournament and the Lotus Tournament) before Ward's final victory on the British circuit in 1956, the British PGA Championship at Maesdu. Ward represented Great Britain on three occasions in the Ryder Cup, in 1947, 1949 and 1951, although he only enjoyed one victory in his six matches, losing twice to Sam Snead and once to Ben Hogan. Ward died after a short illness in August 2001, a month short of his 90th birthday."

"Marcel Molinès (born December 22, 1928) is a former professional racing cyclist. Molinès is the first cyclist born in Africa to win a stage of the Tour de France. Molinès, born in Algeria (at that time part of France), competed in the 1950 Tour de France in a team representing French North Africa. His background meant neither he nor his teammate, Abdel-Kader Zaaf, suffered in that summer's heat wave. The temperature was so high on the stage from Perpignan to Nîmes that the race stopped at St-Maxime on the Mediterranean coast and many riders ran or even cycled into the sea. Two exceptions were Molinès and Zaaf, who profited from their lowly status and from a widespread disinclination to ride fast by riding 200 km by themselves and sometimes getting up to 20 minutes' lead. Their advantage was enough to make Zaaf the de facto leader of the race and he would have taken the yellow jersey of best rider had he not began to zigzag 15 km (8m) before the end. An official, or perhaps a spectator, pulled him off his bike and let him sleep under a tree. Molinès went on to win by five minutes and became the first cyclist born in Africa to win a stage. His career included riding for big teams such as Peugeot and Dilecta. He has subsequently vanished and nothing is known of his whereabouts or if, like Zaaf, he has died."

"Sudeep Tyagi (born 17 September 1989) is an Indian international cricketer. He is a right arm fast-medium bowler and a right-handed lower order batsman. In first class cricket, he plays for Uttar Pradesh. In the Indian Premier League, he represented Chennai Super Kings. Tyagi is arguably the leading contender for the next bowling spot in the national squad, consistently performing ahead of his peers, whenever fit. Tyagi first represented the senior Uttar Pradesh team at the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy competition, making his debut against Orissa in a game which was highlighted by a double-century from Suresh Raina. It was in this debut match that he took a six-wicket haul, helping his team to an innings victory - a bowling analysis which remains his first-class best. It took until the third match of the competition until he scored his first two first-class runs with the bat. Tyagi finished his stellar debut Ranji season with 41 wickets, the highest in the country. Later in the same month, he played one match in the Duleep Trophy competition, and in February he played in two games in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. While Tyagi missed most of the 2008-09 domestic season due to stress fracture, he re-emerged in 2009 IPL with some great spells. In July 2009, Tyagi travelled with the Indian Emerging Players squad to tour Australia, where the team played against their peers from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Tyagi emerged by far the best bowler on show during the tournament, grabbing 14 wickets in 6 games at 18.21 a piece. Tyagi's strong upper body is built along the lines of his UP colleague Praveen Kumar but he is a few yards quicker than Kumar is. Tyagi and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was equally impressive in his debut domestic season in 2008-2009 and has attracted quite a bit of attention, along with R.P. Singh and Praveen Kumar, form a very impressive pace bowling quartet for Uttar Pradesh. He made his ODI debut in the fifth and final match of India's home series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 at the Feroz Shah Kotla. He took one wicket as India bowled first, but his debut was cut short when the umpires ended the match midway through the Sri Lankan innings after deeming the pitch to be unsafe."

Initially he travelled with a party of Voortrekkers to Natal, and was one of the party of Van Rensburgs who survived an attack by a group of Zulus at Rensburg koppie (Rensburg hill). He subsequently travelled to the Transvaal and settled on a farm in the Rustenburg area in 1848. Van Rensburg was elected as a member of the South African Republic's (ZAR) Volksraad (People's Assembly) in 1850, a post which he held until June 1855. During this period there was a major political conflict between the ZAR's first president and writer of its constitution, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, and its commandant-general, Stephanus Schoeman, who rejected the constitution. Van Rensburg supported Schoeman and in return the latter appointed van Rensburg as a provisional commandant. Van Rensburg subsequently represented Schoeman in negotiations with Pretorius's faction. In 1858, when Schoeman fell ill, Van Rensburg was appointed as acting commandant-general. Van Rensburg went on to play an essential role in uniting the former Lydenburg Republic with the ZAR and also supported Pretorius when he tried to unite the ZAR and the Orange Free State Republic. In February 1860, during Pretorius's absence, the Volksraad offered Van Rensburg the post of State President, which he refused. Following substantial political maneuvering, Van Rensburg was elected as the Second President of the ZAR in April 1863. However, Van Rensburg refused to be sworn in and a second election had to be held. During this election Van Rensburg received 1,106 votes and Pretorius 1,065; Van Rensburg accepted his election this time and he took his oath of office on 23 October 1863. Pretorius's supporters did not support the results of the election and what amounted to a civil war broke out. When the fighting came to a halt in January 1864 another presidential election was held and Pretorius was re-elected; he was sworn in on 9 May 1864. Van Rensburg subsequently returned to his farm near Rustenburg, where he died and was buried shortly afterwards. However, in August 1974, Van Rensburg and his wife were disinterred and reburied at the Heroes' Acre cemetery in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa."

Côté formally charged a number of pro-union rally participants, individuals and businesses, all from outside Quebec, with violating the province's spending laws by transporting people to Montreal for the rally. The move was heavily criticized by federalists within Quebec and across Canada. Federalists accused Côté of minimizing the unusually high number of spoiled ballots from pro-federalist ridings. A later investigation of the Côté and the referendum found no evidence to support accusations of wrongdoing. In 1998, Cote was named an officer of the National Order of Quebec. Côté died on June 17, 2013, at the age of 85."

"John Charles Frémont or Fremont (January 21, 1813 – July 13, 1890) was an American military officer, explorer, and politician who became the first candidate of the anti-slavery Republican Party for the office of President of the United States. During the 1840s, when he led four expeditions into the American West, that era's penny press and admiring historians accorded Frémont the sobriquet The Pathfinder. During the Mexican–American War, Frémont, a major in the U.S. Army, took control of California from the Bear Flag Republic in 1846. Frémont then proclaimed himself military Governor of California; however, for that he was convicted in court martial for mutiny and insubordination. After President Polk commuted his sentence, Frémont led a fourth expedition, which cost ten lives, seeking a rail route over the mountains around the 38th parallel in the winter of 1849. He retired from military service and settled in California. Frémont acquired massive wealth during the California Gold Rush, but he was soon bogged down with lawsuits over land claims, between the dispossession of various land owners during the Mexican–American War and the explosion of Forty-Niners immigrating during the Rush. These cases were settled by the U.S. Supreme Court allowing Frémont to keep his property. Frémont became one of the first two U.S. senators elected from the new state of California in 1850. He was the first presidential candidate of the new Republican Party, carrying most of the North. He lost the 1856 presidential election to Democrat James Buchanan when Know-Nothings split the vote and Democrats warned his election would lead to civil war. During the American Civil War, he was given command of Department of the West by President Abraham Lincoln. Although Frémont had successes during his brief tenure as Commander of the Western Armies, he ran his department autocratically, and made hasty decisions without consulting Washington D.C. or President Lincoln. After Frémont's emancipation edict that freed slaves in his district, he was relieved of his command by President Lincoln for insubordination. In 1861, Frémont was the first commanding Union general who recognized an \""iron will\"" to fight in Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant and promoted him commander at the strategic base near Cairo, Illinois. After the Civil War, Frémont's wealth declined after investing heavily and purchasing an unsuccessful Pacific Railroad in 1866. Frémont served as Governor of Arizona appointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes and served from 1878 to 1881. Frémont, retired from politics and financially destitute, died in New York City in 1890. Historians portray Frémont as controversial, impetuous, and contradictory. Some scholars regard him as a military hero of significant accomplishment, while others view him as a failure who repeatedly defeated his own best purposes. The keys to Frémont's character and personality may lie in his being born illegitimately, his ambitious drive for success, self-justification, and passive-aggressive behavior."

"Wang Ming (Chinese: 王明; pinyin: Wáng Míng; May 23, 1904 - March 27, 1974) was a senior leader of the early Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the mastermind of the famous 28 Bolsheviks group. Wang was also a major political rival of Mao Zedong during the 1930s, opposing what he saw as Mao's nationalist deviation from the Comintern and orthodox Marxist–Leninist lines. According to Mao on the other hand, Wang epitomized the intellectualism and foreign dogmatism Mao criticized in his essays \""On Practice\"" and \""On Contradiction\"". The competition between Wang and Mao was a reflection of the power struggle between the Soviet Union, through the vehicle of the Comintern, and the CCP to control both the direction and future of the Chinese revolution."

"John George Diefenbaker, PC, CH, QC,  (/ˈdiːfənˌbeɪkər/; September 18, 1895 – August 16, 1979) was the 13th Prime Minister of Canada, serving from June 21, 1957 to April 22, 1963. He was the only Progressive Conservative (PC or Tory) party leader between 1930 and 1979 to lead the party to an election victory, doing so three times, although only once with a majority of seats in the Canadian House of Commons. Diefenbaker was born in southwestern Ontario in 1895. In 1903, his family migrated west to the portion of the North-West Territories which would shortly thereafter become the province of Saskatchewan. He grew up in the province, and was interested in politics from a young age. After brief service in World War I, Diefenbaker became a noted criminal defence lawyer. He contested elections through the 1920s and 1930s with little success until he was finally elected to the House of Commons in 1940. Diefenbaker was repeatedly a candidate for the PC leadership. He gained that party position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the Tories to their first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a snap election and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his Cabinet, as well as the first aboriginal member of the Senate. During his six years as Prime Minister, his government obtained passage of the Canadian Bill of Rights and granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In foreign policy, his stance against apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government's downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered for his role in the 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project. Factionalism returned in full force as the Progressive Conservatives fell from power in 1963, and while Diefenbaker's performance as Opposition Leader was heralded, his second loss at the polls prompted opponents within the party to a leadership convention in 1967. Diefenbaker stood for re-election as party leader at the last moment, but only attracted minimal support and withdrew. He remained an MP until his death in 1979, two months after Joe Clark became the next Tory Prime Minister."

"Ali Sadikin (7 July 1927 – 20 May 2008) was an Indonesian politician of Sundanese background. He was often called Bang Ali. He served as the governor of Jakarta, the country's capital, from 1966 to 1977. He would be known as the longest-serving governor of Jakarta from 1966-1977. Appointed by a weak Sukarno, he likely had the full approval of Suharto. A former officer in the Indonesian Marine Corps, he saw the city as a battlefield. He sought to improve public services, clear out slum dwellers, ban becaks (cycle rickshaws), and outlaw street peddlers. Sadikin's role in bulldozing poor areas of Jakarta was part of a long history of struggle over land use in the region  Through legislation, Sadikin successfully wrested control over large amounts of poor housing. These areas he gave at minimal cost to developers such as the Jaya Group. For Abidin Kusno, Sadikin was part of a modernist program to attack irrationality, criminalize poverty, and create obedient national citizens. At the same time, he sought to kampung-ize city dwellers—to reinvest them with village sociality and mutual aid (gotong royong). Sadikin also tried to halt migration into Jakarta by declaring the city closed to newcomers. He issued residency cards in hope of enforcing the policy, but failed to curtail population growth. One of the earliest and most outspoken advocates of family planning, Sadikin showed that Muslim groups would support these policies. Under Sadikin, Jakartan pilgrimage to Mecca and other holy places surged. Hungry for revenue for his projects, Sadikin legalized gambling and steambaths (de facto brothels), much to the outrage of many Muslim groups. Although Sadikin's restructuring of land in Jakarta displaced countless urban poor, he also advocated for the LBH, the Legal Aid Society; an organization which was used by both the private sector and the urban poor. After having allegedly \""allowed\"" Golkar to lose an election in Jakarta, Sadikin was removed from office. Despite Sadikin's heavy-handed urban reforms, he is often cited as a popular leader. In 1978, mass student protests embroiled the capital, and students nominated Sadikin as an alternative president. In 1980, Sadikin helped found and lead the Petition of Fifty, a group of powerful and highly influential critics of the New Order. He regularly hosted their meetings at his home. Though he remained a resolute statist in favor of militarism, he opposed Suharto's consolidation of power in the government and military (ABRI). It is likely that Sadikin's stature and popularity both bolstered the Petition of Fifty and helped to shield it from more severe repression. Sadikin died in Singapore on 20 May 2008."

A successful Northampton lawyer prior to 1774, Strong was politically active in the rebel cause during the American Revolutionary War.

Although he sought to retire from politics after losing the 1807 governor's race, the advent of the War of 1812 brought him back to the governor's office as a committed opponent of the war. He refused United States Army requests that state militia be placed under army command, and in 1814 sought to engage Nova Scotia Governor John Coape Sherbrooke in peace talks. The state and federal government's weak defense of Massachusetts' northern frontier during Strong's tenure contributed to the successful drive for Maine's statehood, which was granted in 1820."

Some of her themes include biblical plagues, the Holocaust, Hiroshima, and nuclear threat. The breadth of Beerman's career is evident through her grants, awards, and exhibitions list. Some include a CAPS grant from New York State Council on the Arts (1971), the Childe Hassam purchase award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1977), the Camargo Foundation Award (1980), a distinguished artist grant from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts (1987), and a 40-year retrospective of her work, held at the State Museum of New Jersey in Trenton (1991). Her work has been exhibited globally, including at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, NY. In 2000, Beerman was an Artist's Book Resident at the Women's Studio Workshop in Rosendale, New York. During her residency, Beerman published Faces, a limited-edition portfolio of eight drypoint prints with text from The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge by Rainer Maria Rilke. The images are rough, humorous and tragic, echoing the artist’s humanistic concerns."

"Dick de Groot (born 1920) was born in Scheveningen, a beach suburb of The Hague in the Netherlands. After the usual schooling that prepared him for the business world he decided to follow his old dream of being a painter. He studied five years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and took post-graduate classes in sculpture. In 1959 de Groot came to America with his wife Hans and five children. He started painting gigantic faces, foaming glasses of beer and entire scenes up to eighty feet (24 m) long, for the advertising industry. A good year of this was enough and Dick went on his own, doing murals, portraits in oils or bronze, always on commission. A long period of involvement in business followed and he kept painting in spare time, without the pressure of having to make a living at it. Now, in retirement he can do as he pleases and describes his work as follows: I refuse to paint \""sure sellers\"", such as the cute, the corny, the romantic, the sentimental, the narrative. My favorite subject is the contemporary American urban scene, which I find exciting and uniquely suited to my taste. I like to use clues that give an illusion of space, or only a suggestion of it around the corner or beyond the hill. The opposites of mass and space, of volumes and voids intrigue me. They are the basis of my compositions. The urban landscape is rich in geometric planes that can be arranged in expressive combinations of color and light-dark values. I want to see each element in my work in harmony with the total. That includes clouds, traffic signs, telephone poles etc. I will change the subject to suit my purpose. Things are moved, added or left out in a process of translating reality into a painted and new reality, that may be subjectively interpreted."

As Voris Marker, she also worked as a sculptor. Born Voris Linthacum in Baker City, Oregon according to her marriage certificate, but growing up on a ranch near Billings, Montana, Voris worked as a copy-writer for an advertising agency in Chicago after finishing school in Montana. While in Chicago, she had to have an operation on her leg, which led to her returning home as an invalid. Whilst recuperating, Voris came across a piece of soft chamois leather, which inspired her to use it to make up clothing. She made a golf skirt for a Spokane woman to wear in a tournament. Other players and spectators noticed the skirt, and asked Voris to make them leather garments too. She founded her business, Suedes by Voris, in 1933, and by 1940, had shops in Hollywood (where she sold garments to many actors) and across the South West, selling a wide range of clothing entirely made in suede. Her range included day and evening wear, hats, jewelry, and men's jackets, shirts, and ties, made in a wide range of colors. One noted design was a gold-plated evening jacket. When the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli visited Neiman Marcus and was invited to choose any one thing she wanted from the store; she chose a Voris coat as \""the most distinctive fashion she had ever seen by an American designer.\"" It has been suggested that this inspired the decision to award Voris the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1942. Voris later gave up the business to dedicate herself to sculpting. Following her receipt of the Neiman Marcus award, she was commissioned to create a bronze portrait of Herbert Marcus, the co-founder of the store.

"R. Sawan White is a contemporary, abstract artist, residing in Lincoln, Rhode Island. White studied art at Virginia Commonwealth University for two years, then transferred to the Loughborough University School of Art and Design in Loughborough, England. White received a First Degree in Fine Art Printmaking with highest honors from Loughborough University. After graduating from University, White continued in the area of printmaking. In 2001, White began collecting secrets from friends, family, acquaintances, and strangers. This led to an installation piece in the local Artspace Gallery entitled Close. in 2002. This installation explored the dual meaning of the word \""close\""—both how we reveal parts of ourselves to become close to others, and how we hold back, closing ourselves off from others. Hundreds of secrets were typed up, placed in tiny plastic baggies, and encased in plaster. White then created small prints inspired by the secrets, and repeated the process, placing the prints in tiny baggies and then encasing them in plaster. The result was hundreds of plaster squares - some with original prints and some with secrets peeking out from behind the plaster. During the installation, the viewers were surrounded by hundreds of strangers' secrets—some out in the open, some partially revealed, and some hardly visible at all. This installation preceded the PostSecret art project by several years. Currently, White's paintings are formed by layering oil paints and a wax–resin blend onto wood panels. Though similar to encaustic painting, White does not add pigments to the wax and resin blend. Instead, the unpigmented wax/resin blend is added in between layers of oil paint. During this process, White etches into the layers of paint and wax. This process allows White to create a depth and texture that adds to the feel and experience of the work. White is represented by the Blue Gallery in Kansas City, Missouri, the Moberg Gallery in Des Moines, Iowa, and the Eric Schindler Gallery in Richmond, VA."

"Andrea Lilio (1555 - 1642) was an Italian painter born in Ancona, hence he also is known as L'Anconitano. He painted mainly in his native city, as well as in Rome, where he was active from the beginning of the 17th century until around 1640.

"Evaristo Baschenis (December 7, 1617 – March 16, 1677) was an Italian Baroque painter of the 17th century, active mainly around his native city of Bergamo. He was born to a family of artists. He is best known for still lifes, most commonly of musical instruments. This could explain his friendship with a family with notable violin makers from Cremona. Still-life depiction were uncommon as a thematic among Italian painters prior to the 17th century. Baschenis, along with the more eccentric 16th century painter Milanese Arcimboldo, represents provincial outputs with idiosyncratic tendencies that appear to appeal to the discernment of forms and shapes rather than grand manner themes of religious or mythologic events. For Arcimboldo, the artifice is everything; for Baschenis, the items, man-made musical instruments, have a purpose and a beauty even in their silent geometry. One source for his photographic style of still life could be Caravaggio's early painting of peaches, or alternatively, Dutch paintings. The most faithful imitator of his style is a younger contemporary Bergamese, Bartolomeo Bettera. Baschenis is a contemporary of the Bergamese portrait artist, Carlo Ceresa, and appears to have been influential for the Modenese artist Cristoforo Munari."

Called by Walt Kelly, the creator of Pogo, \""the best in the business\"", Norris' cartoons skewered the foibles of British Columbia politics and social mores with a barbed pencil.

He apprenticed initially with Lorenzo di Credi and Antonio del Ceraiolo, but then moved into the studio of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, from whom he acquired the name Michele di Ridolfo or Michele (di Ridolfo) del Ghirlandaio.
