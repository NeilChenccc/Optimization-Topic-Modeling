here is the code of NLDA topic modeling. To run the code, you need python run_topic.py . run_topic.py  contains the code using NLDA and you can change the tuning parameters on line 43. The data is stored under data  dir. The raw data has the format xxx_raw.csv and the output topics has the format xxx_topics.csv run_topic.py will output the topic file and print all noisy words in the command line. You can change the output file location in run_topic.py . This file will do NLDA for unigrams and bigrams. In bigrams, the space is replaced with $ e.g. donald trump will become donald$trump.
