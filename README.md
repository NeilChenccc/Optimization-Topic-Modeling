# Optimization-Topic-Modeling

## Introduction 
Topic modeling, a machine learning technique that automatically detects topics for a set of documents, are crucial in the data analysis process of social media posts, emails, chats, open-ended survey responses, etc. By using topic analysis models, businesses are able to offload simple tasks onto machines instead of overloading employees with too much data (Pascual, 2019).

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model for collections
of discrete data such as text corpora, which is one of the most popular methods in topic
modeling. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is
modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as
an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling,
topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. Therefore, the words
with a higher frequency will be placed on more emphasis.
